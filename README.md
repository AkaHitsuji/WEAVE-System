# WEAVE System
WEAVE is a video streaming system created by my group for the SCDF Innovation Challenge 2018. Through WEAVE, involved parties can work together to keep each other updated and respond to emergencies quicker, thus reducing delay. The three main parties involved are:
1. The Caller
2. The Operator
3. Paramedic

## Three main apps
WEAVE is made up of three main apps, the user mobile app, the operator dashboard, and the paramedic tablet app. For prototyping purposes, the user and paramedic app were made with Xcode to be used on an iPhone and an iPad. The Xcode projects were built off the Twilio starter projects. The Operator dashboard was a web app coded in HTML and CSS.

## Contents of this project
- [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for video streaming
- Xcode to create frontend UI for iPhone and iPad interface
- HTML, CSS, JS for operator dashboard
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) for AED IoT System
- Tested Google Voice API Integration
